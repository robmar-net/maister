**ACTION REQUIRED**: This command delegates to a subagent. The `<command-name>` tag refers to THIS command, not the target. Invoke the production-readiness-checker subagent via the task tool NOW. Pass path and target arguments. Do not read files, explore code, or execute workflow steps yourself.

**IF YOU ARE ALREADY THAT AGENT** (you were invoked via the task tool with this `agent_type`), do NOT delegate — you would be calling yourself. Perform the review directly with your own instructions and return the result.

You are verifying production deployment readiness using the `production-readiness-checker` subagent.

## Your Task

You are performing comprehensive production readiness analysis covering configuration, monitoring, error handling, performance, security, and deployment considerations.

## Parse User Request

**Determine the following from the user's request:**

1. **Path to analyze**:
   - If provided: Use the specified path
   - If not provided: Use ask_user to ask what to check

2. **Target environment**:
   - If `--target=prod`: Full production checks (recommended)
   - If `--target=staging`: Relaxed staging checks
   - If not specified: Assume production (full rigor)

## Your Instructions

**Invoke the production-readiness-checker subagent NOW using the task tool:**

```
Use task tool:
  agent_type: "maister-copilot:production-readiness-checker"
  description: "Production readiness check"
  prompt: |
    Verify production readiness at: [path from user or from ask_user]
    Target: [production|staging]
    Report path: [path]/production-readiness-report.md
```

**Wait for the subagent to complete before proceeding.**

The production-readiness-checker subagent will:
1. Verify configuration management (env vars, secrets, feature flags)
2. Check monitoring & observability (logging, metrics, error tracking, health checks)
3. Assess error handling & resilience (retries, circuit breakers, graceful shutdown)
4. Evaluate performance & scalability (connection pooling, caching, rate limiting)
5. Review security hardening (HTTPS, CORS, security headers, vulnerabilities)
6. Analyze deployment considerations (migrations, zero-downtime, rollback plan)
7. Generate go/no-go deployment recommendation

## Examples

**Example 1**: Check specific task for production
```
User: /maister-copilot:reviews-production-readiness .maister/tasks/development/2025-10-24-payment-api/
```

**Example 2**: Check feature for staging
```
User: /maister-copilot:reviews-production-readiness src/features/notifications/ --target=staging
```

**Example 3**: Comprehensive project check
```
User: /maister-copilot:reviews-production-readiness .
```

## What to Expect

The production-readiness-checker will provide:
- Overall readiness score and status (Ready / Concerns / Not Ready)
- Clear GO/NO-GO deployment decision
- Category scores (Configuration, Monitoring, Error Handling, Performance, Security, Deployment)
- Deployment blockers that must be fixed
- Concerns with mitigation plans
- Recommendations for improvements
- Risk assessment and rollback criteria
- Post-deployment verification checklist

## Deployment Decision Outcomes

**Ready to Deploy**:
- All critical checks passed
- Low risk deployment
- Optional improvements listed

**Deploy with Caution**:
- No blockers but concerns exist
- Mitigation plan required
- Close monitoring needed
- Medium risk

**Do Not Deploy**:
- Critical issues present
- High/critical risk
- Must fix before deployment

## Notes

- This is verification only - no code will be modified
- Production checks are more rigorous than staging
- Focus on required items first (deployment blockers)
- Strongly recommended items should be addressed or have mitigation plan
- Nice to have items can be addressed post-deployment
